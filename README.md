# 990PF_project
#project for Metis Intro to Data Science spring 2016

What is the question you hope to answer? 
Private operating foundations are required to distribute a minimum amount (based on their investment returns) for charitable purposes each year. I am interested in seeing how far above the minimum distrbution is typical, and whether this amount is correlated with anything else.

What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 
The IRS has made available extracts of selected financial data filed by tax-exempt organizations in the years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. I will be looking specifically at the extracts of Form 990-PF, which is filed by private foundations, for fiscal years 2012 and 2013.

What do you know about the data you're using so far? 
The data contains approximately 100,000 samples and 187 features. Several of the features are variations of one another (for instance, subtotals that make up a total), so some feature engineering will be required before any analysis can be performed.

Why did you choose this topic? 
I work in fundraising for a large non-profit and am interested in better understanding the private grant-making world.
